It sought a maritime route from the Atlantic via South America into the Spice Islands. There was enough salted and dried food for two years that constantly needed replenishment of fresh fruits, vegetables, meats, fish, potable water, and firewood. Sailors recognised hunger, scurvy, and beriberi as enemies just like storms and shipwreck. Magellan sensing a long journey, decreased daily rations as allowed legally. In December 1519, four months into the provisions some men grumbled and asked to increase their food. Magellan appealed to their loyalty to the Crown and appeased them. He reminded that they had been finding abundant fresh food since they had left Spain. But the next year on the night of Palm Sunday April 1 , 1520 some officers mutinied! They seized three of the boats, then ransacked and distributed food to the crew hoping to win their loyalty for a trip back to Spain. They were 8 months into the journey. Two leaders were executed and two other instigators exiled to Patagonia. Forty of the crew were not executed because they were needed to sail the ships. One ship got wrecked and it seems its provisions went down with the boat although the crew survived. They transferred to the remaining four boats that stretched their food to accommodate them. By August 1520 the armada had reached the midway point of their stored provisions. In November of 1520, Magellan discovered the passage that led to the unknown Pacific Ocean. The San Antonio deserted and returned to Spain. Magellan should have had 8 months of food left when the remaining 3 ships crossed the Pacific Ocean on November 28, 1520. But they did not expect the vastness of the Pacific they were discovering for Europe. They survived by eating rats, the main yard cover made of ox hide, and sawdust from the ship's boards. They were unable to fish in the deep waters.

HOLY WEEK ABSTINENCE,,,"The expedition to the Spice Islands with Magellan in command experienced Holy Weeks in 1520, 1521, and 1522. Conforming to the Catholic rituals was important to the crew. Their lives were constantly in peril, especially from storms and hunger. The first Palm Sunday was 8 months into their provisions to last 2 years. They had anchored at St. Julian port in Argentina where autumn was starting in the Southern Hemisphere. The geese and sea-wolves they hunted as fresh food were penguins and seals, respectively. In 1521, Palm Sunday was at Homonhon Island, Samar form where on Holy Monday they sailed south. By Good Friday, March 29 according to Pigafetta's reckoning, they were in Mazaua (Limasawa) of Southern Leyte. Their Easter Sunday was celebrated with a meal of two swine given by Datus Colambu and Siauri. The meal was cooked on board. The last Holy Week (with Elcano now skippering the Victoria) found them somewhere in the Indian Ocean where on April 16 they headed north to Africa. Modern calculations identify March 26, 1522 as Easter Sunday. There was no feasting. The men were suffering inanition and catabolysis: the effects of extreme starvation. Whatever provisions they had loaded in Tidore, the center for clove, had deteriorated or been consumed. Their Philippine Holy Week, with Magellan still alive, was the friendliest of their foreign Easters.","Ferdinand Magellan; Sebastian Elcano; Antonio Pigafetta; Datu Colambu; Datu Siauri; Spice Islands; Argentina; Homonhon Island, Samar; Limasawa; Mazaua; Leyte; Tidore",Commemorative collectible for the Quincentennial,Magellan Menu,Image;Still Image,image/png,,,

Pigafetta and comrades ate 35 different meats including peacock during a welcome meal sent to them by the Bornean Sultan.  For their audience with him, they were fetched by elephants. One wonders what was served at the farewell meal hosted by Humabon in Cebu after Magellan’s death.  He invited the crew and said he would give them the gold jewelry they knew he had had crafted for the Spanish King.  The new Armada leader wanted to secure from Humabon guides who knew the route to the Moluccas. The meal turned out to be a trap and almost everyone who went was massacred. Pigafetta had been wounded in the face by an arrow and was swollen, so could not go.  The three ships left immediately. One wonders if the Armada would have gotten to the Spiceries quicker than they had if Magellan and his Malay slave Enrique were with them. Magellan had likely reached Mindanao from Portuguese territories when he was still a soldier-sailor for the country of his birth. No one knows with certainty what was Enrique’s fate. Wanting freedom, did he plan the massacre with Humabon? Others suggest he was killed because he wore Spanish garments and would have been mistaken for one. Was Lapulapu in with the plot? No one knows for sure.

RESTOCKING,,,"Renaissance food preservation for naval voyages was limited to mostly dried, salted and dried, or brined foods.  Replenishing fresh supplies including water was mandatory for survival. Fresh foods the circumnavigation crew found in the Philippines included some familiar to them like pigs and chickens.  The domesticated varieties were usually prestige foods used in pagan rituals for thanksgiving and when requesting bountiful food, safe childbirth, and healing.  The crew of mixed European ethnicities also found familiar fish, crab, goat, citruses, bananas, honey, salt, ginger, garlic, rice, millet, panicum and sorghum. Magellan and his Malay slave Enrique would have known the foods of Insular Southeast Asia. Pigafetta from Vicenza seems to have tried coconut for the first time. He wrote of its uses as wine, vinegar, oil, water, milk and a substitute for bread. Although rice was cooked in a clay pot above fire as in Spain, rice was also cooked in a bamboo tube placed under fire.  He found cakes wrapped in leaves, some of rice and others of millet.  One rice cake was called tinapay, according to him. Other foods he and his mates may have found unusual were bat meat, turtle eggs and tabon eggs. He heard about a delicacy called Laghan Snails found attached to the hearts of dead whales.

Ships and villages were raided for supplies. Hostages were ransomed for food. In Cebu, Magellan required a food quota for chiefs loyal to Rajah Humabon. Humabon, the Captain’s blood brother, had pledged allegiance to the Spanish King. He was expected to assist the royal armada. When one village refused to give its quota, Magellan burned it. Such terrorist tactics were an underlying cause for the Battle of Mactan. Lapulapu spurned the order. He fought to protect his people and their right to food security. Political competition among local chiefs was likely not his sole motive. Antonio Pigafetta was from the Republic of Venice, a rival in the spice trade. The passenger manifesto does not name him. It lists an Antonio Lombardo, Lombardy being within Spain’s Italian realm. He was among those added legally beyond the passenger cut off.

There could have been roughly 130 men for Magellan to find new water and food for. The peaceful strategies were firstly, to fish, hunt and forage at uninhabited islands or places where islanders allowed them to. The swine eaten at Homonhon Island may have been hunted there. No mention is made if they were carried from Guam. A second means is to receive food as gifts. The 9 men from Samar’s Suluan Island, the first of ancestral Filipinos to encounter the Spanish Armada, gave fish, 2 coconuts, assorted banana, and a jar of native wine from their supplies. One suspects the Europeans could not have fattened up in the 10 days from the time they secured food in Guam to the time they met the Suluans. The natives could have recognised the look of sailors who had suffered extreme hunger. The third means is to barter for food. The Suluans returned after 4 days with rice, chicken and other foodstuff which were paid for with beads, caps, textiles, clothing and other goods. But the ships carried only a finite amount of trade items and they were needed to purchase spices in Maluco, their ultimate destination.",Suluan Island; Cruxificion,CRUCIFIXION by Juan Flandes. 1519.

He also notes some not included in his Philippine stories. One of them is Guava that he tasted in the Malucho islands. He describes it as tasting like peach. In Renaissance art, the peach symbolised purity; a rotten or half-eaten one meant a woman's reputation was compromised. Other foods specified by Pigafetta are almonds, sweet and tasty pomegranates, watermelons, wild cucumbers, gourds, and comulicai similar to a large cucumber. He made a vocabulary of ""words spoken by Moro people in the area"" (also called ""A Malay Vocabulary"") noting they had only been there for the last 50 years having pushed the indigenous peoples upland to where the clove trees grow wild. In central Philippines he listed as food ""roots like turnips"" but he had no word for them. In the vocabulary he calls them ubi.

In the Philippines he learned to eat insular Southeast Asian style: seated on a mat instead of on a chair at a table. While some places had wooden or golden spoons, he knew eating with fingers (of only the right hand in Muslim areas) was common. Rulers had porcelain and gold plates and serving dishes. One ate coconut meat chunks or rice cooked as solid as bread. Rice was the desired cereal, a food eaten in Spain and Italy because Moors from the Near East had cultivated it when they ruled Spain. Everywhere there was swine, goat, poultry, fish. One had to carry them live and slaughter as needed. The crew did not have salt to preserve the cuts while they sailed, he wrote. All around the region were coconut, banana, possibly also sugarcane. Praus bartered firewood needed for cooking on board. Water could be bought in long bamboo tubes that needed to be stored upright. One needed attractive fabrics, hats, clothing, glass beads, and metal to exchange for food. Otherwise one used kidnapping for ransom, storming small villages, and capturing laden boats to secure food. The easterly winds they had been waiting for were blowing but they were unsure how to get home. Portuguese knew the route but they were the enemy and needed to be avoided at all costs.

His snippets also noted there was no great emperor lording over insular Southeast Asia; island kings fought each other even after intermarriage among their families; trade was an important factor for peace and political power; food was traded and given as gifts; feasting together could be a sign of friendship or a means to poison or hack away at guests. There was no campaign to make pagans Muslim. In Tidore, the crew killed all swine on board they had been keeping for food to please the Muslim King, their partner for securing clove and some nutmeg in the Moluccas. He gave them goats and poultry in exchange. It was known in the area and respected that Muslims did not like the looks and smells of pork. The provisions from Asia ran out. All the men on the carrack ""Victoria"" were starving as they reached Africa, but they refused to stop at Portuguese centres for food lest they be captured. The 18 who made it back to Sanlucar and Seville were emaciated. Their captain, Juan Sebastian Elcano (1476-1526), was rewarded by the king with gold ducats and a personal crest bearing the singular motto: Primus circumdedisti me. (You were the first to circumnavigate me.) His coat of arms is decorated with clove and cinnamon, appropriately.

After receiving two at Homonhon Island in March he wrote about how a coconut tree provided bread, wine, oil and milk. The size of a human head, a nut has a green husk thicker than two fingers. Certain filaments in the husk make a cord with which to bind native boats. Under the husk is a hard shell thicker than a walnut's that is burned and made into a useful powder. [Medicinal] Under that shell is a white marrowy substance one finger in thickness eaten fresh with meat and fish as if it were bread. It tasted like almond to him; he explained it could be dried and eaten, too. In the middle of the marrowy substance is a clear, sweet, refreshing water. When that water stands for a while after having been collected, it congeals and becomes like an apple. He described making a butter-like oil by boiling coconut marrow and water that had putrefied (fermented). When they wish to make vinegar, they let pure coconut water ferment under the sun. He learned to make coconut milk by scraping the marrow, mixing it with its own water, then straining it through cloth. He was told one tree could live to be a hundred years old.

Although fabrics, clothing, metal, hats, glass beads and other items were carried to trade for food, capturing a boat and taking prisoners to be ransomed for food was a common strategy. Word spread it was best to feed the foreigners and let them be off on their quest. On July 29, 1521 (3 months after Magallanes died), Pigafetta's colleagues captured a feared captain-general of the Bornean king. He turned out to be the son of the ""king of Luzon."" Pigafetta used ""king"" for lack of another term to mean the head or chief of a community or state whatever its size. Giovan Carvaio, their pilot, let the prince go in exchange for gold!

A TASTE OF VISAYAN FOOD,,,"The first circumnavigation crew would have satisfied their tastebud cravings the way Visayans did. One of Pigafetta’s most important observations is that the natives knew natural fermentation: coconut vinegar and alcoholic beverages of coconut, nipa, and rice. Before fermentation, tuba was sweetish. Along with honey, ripe fruits, and fresh sugarcane juice one’s sweet tooth could be satisfied. Tastebuds are warning devices of the human body, alerting when there is not enough or a surfeit of a taste that could cause sickness, even emotional imbalance. Sourness came from the coconut vinegar and native lemon. Salty was satisfied by salt. In fact Pigafetta found some dishes too salty. What could have been bitter? Charred meat as well as cinnamon and clove if they chewed on them. Maybe foraged fruits and leaves? Umami desire was satisfied by savory, “proteiny” cooked meats and meaty broths. No tastebud has been found reacting only and specifically to piquancy, so it is considered a mouth feel. Raw garlic and ginger provided the pricking to perk up a meal. Even if Pigafetta likely left out describing other culinary experiences, what he did describe celebrates how Filipinos used their surroundings to satisfy tastebuds, hunger and the dream of a good meal.

Likely the thickly wrapped cakes were baked inside mounds of hot ash, even the remains of fires used for roasting. (The beehive oven was introduced much later.) While sailing in southern waters he arrived at Borneo. On June 15, 1521 three praus from there brought foods including rice wrapped in leaves. Some resembled sugar loaves in size and shape; others were somewhat longish. There was also rice made in the manner of tarts using egg and honey. He was fetched later by 2 elephants with silk trappings to bring him to and from the Borneo king. The elephants were preceded by a dozen men carrying porcelain jars covered with silk and containing the crew’s gifts. Borneo is really close geographically to the Philippines. One wonders if it is true that the Sultan of Sulu had elephants, their 2 progenitors a gift from the ruler of Java that is also nearby. Dwarf elephants lived on Luzon 2,580,000 to 11,700 years ago. Possibly on Panay, too. They may have been the size of a dog like my rottweiller. ctto “Siamese Army on the March” 1893.

WHEN THE HOLY CHILD FOUND ITS CEBU HOME,,,"On April 14, 1521 Magallanes gave Rajah Humabon’s primary consort, Hara Humamay (baptised Juana), a statue of the Holy Child Jesus made in the Flemish style. Pigafetta recorded that at the time there was not only roasting but, in earthenware pots, cooking. Perhaps the broths with fish or pork were made in them. But he also recorded cooking in bamboo tubes. Broths can be cooked in them as well in shells. Pigafetta preferred the rice cooked in bamboo to that cooked in a pot. He wrote that leaves were used as a pot liner when rice was cooked. In Cebu tagnáwan tree leaves were known in the 19th century to serve the purpose. One wonders if they may have been used because Pigafetta knew banana leaves but did not say they lined pots. In the Philippines the earliest earthenware so far found by the Philippine National Museum is 7,340 years old and from Tawi-Tawi. Pots allow new forms of cooking and give us soups, stews, porridges, and a host of other dishes. ctto If you want to see the Holy Child given in 1521 (shown in photo), it is lovingly conserved at its basilica in Cebu City.",Ferdinand Magallanes; Rajah Humabon; Hara Humamay; earthenware,,Magellan Menu,Image;Still Image,image/png,,,

Pigafetta proves that by writing in 1521 that he ate roast pork and fish. But he doesn’t reveal if the roasting was done on a spit, using something like a barbecue stick or skewer, or laid on a grill that might have been made of wood. Roasting is an early, basic cooking technique. One only needs an open fire to roast. RP archaeological sites in Tawi Tawi and Butuan, areas within the scope of Pigafetta’s voyage had remains of cooked food, likely roasted, as far back as 7,000 years ago and the 11th and 12th centuries of the Common Era, respectively.

The logbook of Victoria, the only ship of five that made it back was written by Francisco Albo from its arrival in Brazil till its return to Spain. Pigafetta was made a Knight of the Order of Rhodes (and Malta) for his valour. His family resided in a “palacio” – although not a grand and large one when compared with those of royalty.

Sorghum is a grass grown for grain and fodder. Today it is the “propinquum” kind of sorghum that Southeast Asia and China cultivate. The third cereal thriving in 1521 was rice that the chronicler said was called BUGHAX BARAS. Perhaps the first word, pronounced “bughas” is today’s BUGAS.

He had distinguished himself in the Portuguese military and maritime service, even reaching Malacca under Alfonso d’Albuquerque who sought to expand the Portuguese empire. Magallanes was no stranger to Asia when he got to the Philippines in 1521. He would have known bananas, coconuts, and other foods that a European crew could live on when food loaded in Spain ran out.

Pigafetta wrote that his co-crew were always invited by the Cebuanos to eat and drink with them, whether day or night. “Their viands are half cooked and very salty. They drink frequently and copiously from the jars through those small reeds,” Pigafetta wrote. He added, “and one meal lasts for five to six hours.” The straws were eco-friendly and could be among the alternatives to plastic straws that started overtaking paper and glass straws in the 1960s.

While Limasawa in southern Leyte is considered to be Mazaua, a case has been made that it might actually have been Masao, in the Caraga area of Mindanao! Historians are debating the evidence again. Millet was likely the fall-back cereal during drought when rice would not grow. Today humas is better known as KABOG, actually the word for fruit bat. It seems fruit bats eat millet and in northern Cebu’s town of Catmon, rice cake of millet is called BUDBUD KABOG. There is even an annual budbud kabog festival every February 10.

WHEN BREAD MEANT RICE CAKE,,,"Tinapay, today’s Filipino word for wheat bread, originally meant “a certain kind of rice cake.” We owe that fact to Pigafetta who in 1521 listed words in the Cebuano area and their meanings. He did not describe tinapay so no one knows what it really was. Did he not encounter other rice cakes, what we call kakanin now? Missionaries of the later 1500s used tinapay as the word for host when explaining it to new native converts. In the 1800s, tinapay was described by the Recollect priest Juan Felix De Encarnación as a flour circle with a sweet filling that was folded in half to resemble the moon. Perhaps because it resembled the circular host, tinapay was selected by pioneering missionaries. They also used tinapay for wheat bread when referring to miracles of Jesus Christ such as feeding a multitude with just a few fish and bread loaves. Filipinos did not know wheat or wheat bread at the time. They were brought by the Spanish. Later “hostia” was introduced as the word for host; tinapay stayed as generic for wheat bread.

In 1521 he wrote that the Cebuano word for vino (wine) was TUBA NIO NIPA. Tuba wine was made from distilling the juice of nipa, the only palm growing in water. The sap flowed from a cut made in a flower stalk (where the globular fruit would grow) conveniently located near the ground. A bamboo pitcher was hung on a joint till it filled with about 2 litres of sap that would ferment into intoxicating wine. Everyone drank too much almost everyday and slept so well that work was put off by Spanish and natives alike. Nipa, pronounced with slight differences, is the local term for “Nipa fruticans” in Indonesia, Malaysia, Antique, Cebu, Leyte, Panay, Samar, Camarines, Albay, Sorsogon, Pampanga, Pangasinan. In other parts of the Philippines it is called sasa or lasa. Into the 1920s nipa was considered a most important plant from an economic standpoint. It was not only still popular as an alcoholic drink but as vinegar. Nipa has feathery leaves stretching 7 meters high and sprouts from a root growing in soil under the waterline. The palm grew in dense clusters hard to penetrate and thus served as a defensive barrier when invaders rowed upstream. In Pangil Bay, Mindanao there was a 9,000 hectare area where nipa grew! North of Manila Bay, mangrove trees were replaced by nipa. Today, nipa forests need replanting.

POOR PIGS,,,"Pigafetta and his crew-mates feasted on pork during their first Easter Sunday in Asia, still in central Philippine waters. That was on March 31, 1521. Easter is the major Christian feast. It celebrates how Jesus Christ died for the sake of his kind, people who believe in him and his church, allowing them life ever after. The native king sent Magallanes (Pigafetta’s boss) two swine for their meal. Thanks to archaeological work by the Philippine National Museum, we know pork was eaten by Filipino ancestors 7,000 years ago. It would have been hunted pig. The Ifugao of northern Philippines fault an overly curious Malimayu for interfering with a divine effort for zero hunger and that would have spared the lives of pigs and stopped hunting them forever. A piece of pork dripping with blood provided by a magical pig was suppose to give delicious meat always. That way only one wild pig would be sacrificed for the sake of its kind. But Malimayu was unfaithful to the instructions. She squeezed and wrung the pork till it had no more blood and died!

They may have purchased a wild jungle fowl (Gallus bankiva) some historians think. Pigafetta recorded the local word for “galina” to be monoch. It is spelled manok in the languages of Bicol, Hiligaynon, Ilocano, Maranaw, Pangasinan, Cebuano, Samar-Leyte, Tagalog; manuk in Pampangan, Ivatan, Maguindanao; manu in Ibanag. In 1613, labuyo meant a wild mountain chicken in Tagalog. Filipinos have been eating chicken for millennia. Archaeologists of the Philippine National Museum found chicken bones at Butuan in Mindanao dating to the 11th and 12th centuries and at Cagayan of northern Luzon in Peñablanca that are 11,000 years old and Lallo, dated as 2,800 years old.",Labuyo; Chicken,,Magellan Menu,Image;Still Image,image/jpeg,,,

It is claimed Spanish knew the banana before the 1492 voyage of Columbus. Arabs may have brought the banana from its cradle of origin, the Eastern Indies to Europe. The term banana traces perhaps to a West African word, BANAANA.

The Trinidad, suddenly leaking badly, would attempt to retrace the Pacific and South American route after making repairs. Meanwhile, the winds were favourable to sail west. On February 11, 1522 Victoria left Timor, the last island with fresh supplies. As they crossed from the South Sea to Africa, as Pigafetta wrote: because they had no salt their food putrified. If Portuguese spotted them, their clove and maps would be confiscated. They would all be taken prisoners. After 9 weeks rounding the Cape of Good Hope in tempestuous seas they reached the Atlantic Ocean. They had broken a mast and were leaking. Being in waters where it was legal for them, they stopped at a Portuguese port on Cape Verde Islands for food feigning they had been exploring Spanish America and were heading home. The ruse worked but not for long. Leaving 13 of their men still ashore, Elcano and all who had remained aboard sailed off to avoid the Portuguese sure to give chase.

It is a “very small fish which is netted, dried in the sun or air, then cooked in various ways.” LAULAU ends a paragraph about fish caught at Bonbon Lake in Batangas.
In 1953 an updated checklist of Philippine fishes was published. Sardinella fimbriata, the round-bodied sardine, was called Lao-Lao or Tamban Lao-Lao commonly. It was a marine species that entered river mouths and was abundant in central and southern Philippines. It also lived in waters of East India, the East Indies and China.

In 1890, Jose Rizal published from Paris an annotated version of Morga’s book. He ventured that LAULAU may have been TAWILIS. Today we know tawilis is the world’s only freshwater sardine and is found in Taal Lake, the current name of Bonbon Lake. The Lake was linked to Balayan Bay by Pansipit River, an actively navigated channel. An eruption in 1754, however, silted up the mouth and a narrower river eventually formed nearby. TAWILIS is Sardinella tawilis, not included in the 1953 list. Admittedly the list was a work in progress.

The foods were not reimbursed by currency or barter goods. They were contributed in theory for the protection and organised governance the foreigners were providing. How were the eggs cooked?

He classified tuba as a clear fluid like water but strong and dry. It is interesting that he noted: “When used moderately, it is medicinal for the stomach and good for phlegms and other kinds of rhems.

Pao or paho (Mangifera altissima) was common and distributed in forests from northern Luzon to southern Mindanao. As of 1921 paho was not cultivated.

ULIKBA added to the diet that included native chicken, some wild and others raised under houses built on stilts. Allan Cooper, Director of the Australian Center for Ancient DNA at University of Adelaide found that all ancient chicken bone samples in the Pacific area have a genetic signature unique to only the Philippines and neighbouring areas. It is not identical to the DNA signature of South American chickens, for instance. Did the Philippines become a center for the spread of chickens carried by ancient Polynesians who brought the fowl on their sailing journeys?

Women raised pigs and chickens while men did more physically demanding work in fields or while fishing. They kept house for “husbands and parents” and did excellent needlework, spun cotton, wove blankets. Women were the home cooks. Important is the implied status of women described by Morga: When both men and women go to church or take a walk along the streets, they walk with slow dignified steps accompanied by male and female slaves who always carry parasols to protect them from rain and sun. The ladies walk ahead followed by their female servants and slaves, then their husbands, fathers and brothers follow with their male servants and slaves. He also noted that there was high literacy, with natives writing using what we call today baybayin. It is an indigenous script that was used as early as 300 CE.

The Chinese quarter with its market, food sellers, and artisans is where exposure to Chinese ingredients and cooked food may have taken place. Intramuros had 600 houses where only Spanish could live; another 600 were outside the walls. Fort Santiago had only 30 soldiers and officers; 8 artillery men guarded the Walled City’s gates. There were at least 150 priests of the different orders living at Intramuros. Most Hispanics lived there with the only other places allowed being Cebu, Villa de Arevalo (Iloilo area), Nueva Segovia (Cagayan), Nueva Caceres (Camarines). There were few Spanish settlers and only a few years before Morga arrived was the colony given a budget for 400 pay-soldiers. Natives revolted and the colony was attacked by Chinese pirates and Borneans wanting to retake their trade route. Filipino food had not yet acquired Spanish influences due to few colonials and opportunities to experience their cuisine.

Morga blundered the first maritime battle with the Dutch in 1600 that lost 137 of 200 men on his flagship. His valet removed his armour and they survived by clinging to a floating mattress. The number of resident colonials were far less than needed and those who stayed needed to be in fortified villages. Wives and children came with some of the career officials. How they coped is not recorded. But food was a challenge and it was natives and Chinese overseas workers who provided for the colonials. In 1603, when Morga was to take on a post in Mexico, the Chinese rebelled against unjust measures, burned half of Intramuros, and killed many residents prompting the largest exodus of Spanish who carried out a great amount of personal wealth.

Bobadilla writes, “Those Chinese merchants are so keen after gain that if one sort of merchandise has succeeded well one year, they take a great deal of it the following year.” So every Christmas season the Spanish were brought small oranges, nuts, chestnuts, raisins, plums, flour and more. A Spaniard lost his nose through a certain illness. He likely couldn’t smell his food anymore. He sent for a Chinese to make him one of wood to hide his deformity. It was so well done that the trader was well rewarded. The next year he brought a fine boatload of wooden noses. But in order to sell, writes Bobadilla, “he would have to cut off the noses of all the Spaniards in the colony.” Figuring out what new products the export market desires is a recurring dilemma even today. In a twist of events, the noses of Catholic statuary were chopped off during the Philippine Revolution that started in 1896 because they looked Spanish.",Chinese; Trading,"“Head of a Man,” Diego Velazquez, c. 1616 the year Bobadilla arrived in Manila.

Diego Bobadilla, SJ notes that starfruit, balimbing, birambi (Averrhoa carambola) could be conserved. It tasted like plum when conserved with honey (later sugars) and smelled like quince when ripe on the tree. “Birimbines” conserve was used on galleon trips back to Mexico. It was even ordered by residents there. Native to tropical Southeast Asia, possibly the Moluccas in particular, it spread to the South Pacific and East Asia, although when remains to be traced. ”Carambola” in Spanish means a canon, the sound of a canon, billiards and the sound of billiard balls hitting each other. Was there a military projectile shaped like starfruit? How and why carambola was applied to a sourish fruit with a cross section resembling a star could remain a conundrum.",Quince; Ferdinand Magellan; Carambola,"Illustration by Kaarin Wall in her book A JAKARTA MARKET published for charities of the American Women’s Association, Jakarta, Indonesia 1983 and 1985.",Diego Bob 1616,Image;Still Image,image/jpeg,,,

Perhaps he ate all three. Calamay was a mixture of honey and flour fried in coconut oil. One also could have buchayo (pronounced boo-kah-yoh ) made of coconut or sesame seed. The terms conserva, buchayo and turron were interchangeable then. Four centuries later, pili turron was included among Philippine creole recipes. Turron means nougat. Introduced to Spain, and possibly first made in Jijona, during Moorish times it combines almond, egg white and honey.

So far we have enumerated since 1521 sugarcane chewed for its sweet juice, honeys and coconut syrup (miel de coco also called polot tuba). There are others for which there is written evidence. They were explained as the native “miel de caña,” sugarcane syrup the Spanish knew. But local versions were: polot panilan (honey from beehive); polot sasa (nipa); polot buli (buri). The latter two are palms like the coconut; the process of making honey from their sap is identical to that of polot tuba. Another important word in “sweet history” from the years being studied is BALÁS. In Pampangan, Cebuano and Tagalog it means crystallised syrup, granulated syrup. Syrups could have been from palms. The progression from syrup to solidified sugar and granules is easily imagined. In 1613 an active Tagalog word was PACASCAS. It was “curds like sugar sold in small baskets by Indios at the Parian [market] of Manila.” To a Spaniard “like sugar” probably meant like sugarcane granules. Pacascas is palm sugars. BAGKAT in Pampangan and Tagalog was likewise active: syrup cooked into a soft candy. When defining Philippine cuisine, precolonial sweeteners have an important role.

They probably rejoiced that Chinese traders annually brought what they hungered for: sugarcane sugar, once called “sweet salt” by Crusader-Knights who saw it for the first time. Sugarcane was known in ancient China but not till the Tang Dynasty (618-907 CE) was refining done. Around 727 Emperor Tai-Tsung sent a delegation to Magadha in India to learn how to turn sugarcane juice into much desired sugar crystals called “tang” in Chinese. From 766-779, a monk in Sichuan taught how to make rock sugar: boiling cane juice into a sticky liquid and letting it flow down a bamboo pipe into an urn where crystals formed. During the subsequent Sung Dynasty (960-1279) sugarcane became a top cash crop in Sichuan and the area from where Chinese workers in the Philippines came, Fukien. There were enough imported ingredients for Spanish to make some of their favourite homeland sweets: sugar, flour, olive oil, pork lard, almonds, raisins among others. But did they? Proof still needed. Natives outside Intramuros were still being converted to Catholicism, coaxed to live in a pueblo where a church would be built, and learn Spanish foods and customs.Two culinary systems for pleasing sweet desires were starting to meet.

He lists 4 cultivated ones. CAMOTE is a sweet potato, Ipomomea batatas. He writes it is the “potatoes of Spain” eaten by colonised and colonisers alike. There is APARI that a 19th-century source describes as white inside, nicely flavoured and called BARIBARAN in Borongan, Samar. UBI is an edible root characterised by a 1613 source as a hand-span or longer and white. A fourth kind was LAQUI. “Mountains furnish roots from which [natives] draw their most usual nourishment,” he added. One was PUGAIAN and the other COROT (Dioscorea triphylla or pentaphylla L.), a yam. Wild tubers were famine food, fallback when cultivated crops failed. Camote was often used as a generic term for all tubers, whatever their genus. How was camote cooked during Bobadilla’s time? He doesn’t say, however a few years before he arrived there is a document. LABON meant cooking a large quantity of tubers or meat. If it was a small amount of tubers it was as LAGA, in the juice or syrup of sugarcane (or likely plain water also). Cooking tubers in water was also called CQISA (gisa) but not referring to today’s stir-frying or complex stewing. Gisa then meant to cook rice, to make SAING that was done by cooking rice (or in this case, tuber) in water. Bobadilla has left insights into heritage cooking.

Leaves were half a meter long and half that wide. Bananas recorded in the 1600s are saba, (healthy and good), bongolan (aromatic, green skinned), bangalan (aromatic, yellow, short), borohan (wild, lots of seeds, sweet), tanyanuang (very long) and sungay cambing (small, short, literally meaning horn of a goat). Some could be cooked in water. Banana originated in Southeast Asia and the South Pacific 5,000 to 8,000 years ago. Arabs brought it westward from India.

Some mats were specifically woven for heavy duty agricultural uses, others finer for everyday functions, and still others so artistically decorated with symbols and colours for ceremonies like those marking rites of passage. The banig is a precious element of Philippine culture to sustain. Bobadilla explained that while common eating was on banana leaves at ground level, the wealthy dined on low tables. They would have been sitting on mats as Pigafetta noted and the tables were low. Dulang is what Tagalogs call the low table that comes in many sizes. Several dulang can be placed end to end for large banquets. Important has been that one could eat with others.",Banig; Dulang,"“Una comida entre gente acomodada” from the Luis Ma.

The latter vessel had 3 layers of stations for rowers on each side. Manpower could reach 100 natives per boat. CARACOA were used as trading ships to carry dried fish, wine, salt, wax, cotton, coconut and other like merchandise in an active coastal trade. Spanish traded wax, storax, Ivory, bezoar in Borneo and Camboa. Two or three Portuguese ships from Macao brought silk, musk, precious stones and fragrant woods. Chinese traders noted in earlier posts brought persimmon and other fruit, parasols, porcelain, cloths the black ones used by Indians, paste gems, thread and the most esteemed whitest silk. Galleons larger than those in the Mediterranean were built at Manila where abaca was used for rigging. The galleon also transported missionaries. A subsidy was added for an outfit of clothing “they are won’t to wear,” a mattress, a blanket and straw for the voyage. Missionaries often lacked enough funds to cover meals while waiting for their galleons to leave Spain and Mexico. Part of their small royal subsidy ended up as handouts demanded at ports by petty bureaucrats.

He explained fears that were real to the draftees: there was neither bread nor wine; the sea terrified; seasickness could keep them flat on their backs the entire trip; strange climate and illnesses could kill them. The Jesuit Pedro de Montes and his group of 20 Jesuits were assigned 3 ordinary cabins 10 feet long by 8 feet wide, and a fourth cabin slightly larger. A group of Jesuits traveling in 1625 had to lie with the feet of one resting on the head of another. Their cabin was a cubbyhole under the quarterdeck. They had to keep their ration of hard sea biscuit that attracted weevils beside them. Their door was so blocked with gear that they crawled into the cabin like cats. No one took off their clothes and soon vermin the size of chickpea attached to them, sucked their blood, and infested their food. At the stopover in Acapulco, bureaucrats refused to lodge them.

It was then that they could taste Mexican cooking in the convents. The typical Pacific crossing was about 75 days. Perhaps because Bobadilla’s family was well known in Madrid and had royal connections, his group was assigned to the smaller of two galleons crossing the Pacific. The priests had a luggage room and the entire quarterdeck to themselves; Bobadilla even had his own room. The captain gave half of his accommodations at the poop deck in addition.

At one descent, 11,000 steps were cut into the path. At Pangil village on the lakeshore, a lay brother awaited them with a “hot meal of enormous proportion,” Horacio de la Costa, SJ recounts in the history of his order published by Harvard University Press in 1961. The alcalde mayor provided boats that sailed them from the lake down Pasig River to the Walled City where bells pealed in welcome. Recruits adjusted to their new island home and its customs.

The Conquista (Conquest) was still on-going. The archipelago had not been pacified fully. Areas had not been reached and among those that had, there were revolts ignited by abuses, some of them because they threatened the food supply. Raids by Borneans and Dutch furthered instability.
The colony was in need of Spanish settlers to develop the islands. Instead they came wanting to make a fortune from the galleon trade and then leave. Even Spanish farmers given privileges by the Crown opted to trade. Promising lands mostly remained uncultivated.
Indios had to provide the colonisers and themselves food. Parishes founded by missionaries aided food security. Chinese were brought in to increase the food supply by cultivating kitchen gardens, labouring in fields, salt farming, baking bread, and importing temperate clime culinary supplies. The Chinese had to feed themselves and as they became Christian and married indias, they strengthened the colony’s food providing capacity. Pagans continued to live off the land with some cultivation in their territories.

Spanish military were confined to forts. Only priests, and there was a shortage of them, interacted with natives.
It was during church festivals that missionaries shared food with their flock. The practice was to have sweets and some wine, native and/or Spanish to make fiestas special. Precolonial festival foods and simple Spanish festival foods were both served: coloured rice dishes; pork. Into the start of the second colonial century, natives were exposed by priests to Spanish Christian cuisine and its customs. Natives learned to bless food, abstain, fast, and feast as Catholics.

He suddenly had 80 persons to house and feed! Dominicans numbered 39 and all were from Spain. He received his brothers in Christ with bell ringing, the playing of wind instruments, and other music. Some slept in the choir loft and others in galleries. There was a clear river where they could bath, books in great abundance, and food always plenty, clean and served punctually.
 It was presumed the group could leave in boats within a few days or that the galleon could continue its voyage.

It was suggested he use it to partially pay porters and cooks.  But the Jesuit refused resolutely. The priests of his domain came with whatever supplies they could to feed the 80 unexpected guests.  He gave thanks that “nothing was owed the Indians” and that his pantry was always full.  It was considered a miracle that two dugong had been caught, “a thing which had not been seen before…for it was .. a great miracle.” Each one, if adult, may have been about 2.6 meters long weighing 300 kilos. Perhaps the marine mammals were preserved with salt or by sun-drying or smoking? The sea-grass eating Dugong dugon is related to manatees and sea cows. It has been hunted since prehistoric times for its meat, oil, skin and bones. There is a 5,000-year-old, Neolithic painting of dugong in Tambun Cave, Ipoh, Malaysia.  Some think it is the inspiration for mermaids.","Dugong;

Upon reaching Manila, they all praised Fr. Melchor “reared in so holy a school as that of the Society of Jesus – where, although one is taught all kinds of knowledge completely, we can say that charity is that which is not taught, because it is inspired.” It took them 2 months to reach the capital due to bad weather. Upon reaching Luzon, they began their long walk over difficult roads and pathways, none paved at the time. Thankfully they made stops at Franciscan missions. In 1665 there were just over 70 missions in the entire archipelago. New missionaries would bring their religion into far off pagan areas where there was still head-hunting, take the place of elder missionaries who could no longer remain in health-challenging environs, fill long vacancies at missions where new Christians could revert to paganism, and also teach in the convents of Intramuros.  In the late 1600s, missionaries were still impassioned by the asceticism and zeal of the late Renaissance and Counter Reformation movement. Simple Spanish cuisine reached native communities where priests proselytised. Philippine cuisine did not yet have sufficient access to foreign influences it could react to.","Catholic Church--Missions--Philippines;

In 1665, the year Filipinas began its 101st year as a colony, Domingo Fernandez Navarrete O.P. was arrested in China for his missionary work and deported. Intending to return to Filipinas where he had taught theology at UST and served in Bataan and Mindoro, he instead found himself in Spain and a new assignment in the New World, Sto. Domingo. In 1676 his book “Tratados historicos, politicos, ethicos, y religiosos de la monarchia de China” was published. (Tratados means “treatises”.) In it he recounts discovering in the mountains of Bataan the “famous fruit considered as a delicacy in China, which is called lechias by the Spaniards and li chi by the Chinese”. He called it (Euphoria litchi) one of the best fruits in the world. The fresh ones he brought to Manila “were the first fresh ones that have been in that city; for those taken thither from China are dried and do not at all resemble the fresh ones.” He ventured that Chinese consider it the queen of fruits. “They are small, being slightly larger than a large nut, and the shell is green and thin. The inside is as white as snow, and it has a kernel in the middle as black as jet. Its savor, taste and odour make one praise the Creator”. The fruit of Chinese origin was growing wild in Bataan where natives called it alipai. Drying lychee extended its edibility and use in cooking. There are many botanicals from the main Asian continent in RP food.","Domingo Fernandez Navarrete O.P.;

Some priests described its taste as similar to sweet grape. He added that NANGKA is the “best fruit in the world”with some of them weighing over 40 libras (28 pounds) each. Its nuts or seeds were savoury when eaten raw or roasted. The Dominican, like other missionaries, called ATES (Anona squamosa L.) the “most superior of all the fruits God created” because of its aroma and taste. As the second colonial century started GUAVA (Psidium guayava) introduced from America had spread so fast it was destroying the pasteurage of cattle that in some areas multiplied greatly. Crows and other birds ate the fruit and dropped the stones to the ground where they took root. Guava was eaten raw or cooked into desired preserves and jellies. (Archaeological digs dated before Spanish settlement reveal guava seeds that could be a Philippine or Asian variety.) PAPAYA from the New World was growing well. There were at least eight kinds of native banana and orange. Manila’s lemons were small. They were DAYAP. One could not tell anymore which fruits were immigrant. The favoured fruits united indios and colonials through food.","Domingo Fernandez Navarrete O.P.;

Domingo Navarrete OP is that indios and creoles both used the residue from making coconut oil in cooking a “very savoury dish with rice”. He adds no description of the dish, however. A creole was a person of pure Spanish blood born in a colony. Those born in Filipinas were known as insulares (islanders) or Filipinos. The natives of Filipinas were called indios. Coconut was a common denominator in at least one food eaten by indios and the Spanish of Manila, and perhaps other parts of the islands. Native wine, likely tuba from coconut inflorescence sap, was mixed with Spanish wine already in the first century as a colonial’s drink. (Refer to #100philippinefood.) Navarrete notes that coconut water when coconut meat is sweet and tender is a healthful beverage. Cocoanut was roasted for the sick, and “after it settled the said water is drunk and produces excellent results.” He offers written evidence of how natives used coconut milk to “cook many of their eatables, among these their rice.” He classifies buchayo as an excellent native conserve. The Spanish were gaining knowledge of islander food and finding those they liked. Culinary experiences in a colonial environment are a two-way discovery by colonial and native of each other’s food customs.","Cooking, Creole;

His book was released in 1676, 11 years into the new century. The missionary challenges he records remained into the 1700s. Navarrete and his companions, for example walked from Calavit uphill to Guistin in Mindoro over jagged rocks that wore out their soles. The bare feet of his Indian companions bled “causing us to overflow with compassion”. They clambered up slopes holding roots. For supper they had a small bit of biscuit soaked in a trifle of mass wine which they also drank for fear of the cold. Natives shared eggs, rice, potatoes. They killed a carabao near a spring and cut it into pieces on the spot to sun-dry. Some of the places they reached had not celebrated mass in 2 to 3 years; no Cura had set foot in others for 14 years. Yet in Mindoro all the Indian villages were full of crosses set up with great neatness. The locals were hospitable. Dugong (mentioned in earlier vignettes) was native food and its bones used to make rosaries. The roe of skate was salted for food. On Bacco Island they were treated to a meal of ray fish. Its liver was considered a finest native delicacy. The Spanish discovered and liked it. To survive, foreigners needed to eat local foods.","Domingo Fernandez Navarrete O.P.;

Likewise the colonial government pleaded for Spanish soldiers. Annual figures reveal how limited and slow was the impact of Spanish soldiers on native cuisine during this era. Our current focus begins in 1665 and the figures for soldiers before it hardly differ from 1670 and 1672. (The exception was 1663 when Governor-General Salcedo arrived with 700 paid soldiers.) The 2,200 minimum military force of pure blooded Spanish was not met. The total figure of Spanish soldiers in Manila were 708 in 1670 and 667 in 1673; Fort Santiago 86, 81; Cavite 225, 211; for both years Cagayan 155, Calamianes 73, Caraga 81, Cebu 145, Oton 169. The annual number of new soldiers wanted was 300 but on the average only 156 came and there were years such as 1686-1688, 1692-1693 when no soldiers arrived. The majority sent were convicts not career military. In the 1650s soldiers from Cavite and Manila roamed the countryside robbing indios because they had not been paid in years. For decades soldiers ate on credit at the Parian or lived with indio women. Like friars, soldiers succumbed to tropical climate and illness. There were clearly limits to indios experiencing Spanish cuisine during this period.","Domingo Fernandez Navarrete O.P.;

We wonder if he tried bird’s nest soup. He wrote, “When cooked with meat [the nests] are a marvel and contain much nourishment. They are given as presents in Manila.” The expensive nests of swiftlets were extracted by hand from craggy limestone rock faces, caves and cliffs. The Calamianes in Palawan have been famous for the product. The nests are made from dried bird saliva and resemble ash-coloured earth often with some feathers and twigs. But when cleaned they become white. (There are naturally orangey and reddish nests too.) Once softened the nests become gelatinous and are a favourite ingredient for nutritious soups that have been a part of Chinese cuisine for at least 400 years. The Portuguese included edible birds nests from Siam and Cambodia among their goods for the Chinese market. Navarrete must have been proud of his knowledge about Asia, an exotic realm. Few people travelled as tourists then.","Domingo Fernandez Navarrete O.P.;

Residents from several long-established barangays had to be convinced to relocate and create a parish. The parish was built with a central square plaza. The church was on one side and the government administrative office on another. Leaders could build their houses on the other two sides. Once firmly established the religious parish could be made a civil entity, a town. Public management was easier with people gathered in one place rather than scattered. Priests found it easier to enforce church education, festivals, tithing, church building and cleaning. By law no one could leave a parish, even temporarily without permission from the parish priest. But a town also made it easier for the tribute collector to gather the rice, textile and, later, coin due the King. Natives preferred to stay far away. Missionaries followed model Spanish town planning. Each family was given an identical amount of land to live and raise food on. They did not own the land. The King owned everything. A parish-town had an area cultivated in common by all residents for the town’s upkeep. Spaniards refused to farm and preferred to trade.","Philippines--History--1521-1896;

Even traditional leading natives were not exempt. Each family was farming to feed itself and pay its tribute to the King, its required tithing to the church and costs of community upkeep. Where terrain could take it, missionaries had introduced the “carabao-powered” plow toward efficiency and better harvest during the first colonial century. During the start of the second century, our focus for now, food shortages occurred and population decreased. Men of a parish were rounded up for the required 40 days of government service (called “polo”) that could be during the seasons of planting and harvesting. There was no one left home to farm rice. Assigned far from their town to fell trees for ship building, crew, and even fight marauders from the south the men often died or their stints were extended up to 8 months. Cooks (sometimes as young as 7 years old) and other staff of priests were exempt from polo. One native revolt after another due to abuses had to be quelled around the islands. No lay Spanish lived in the towns at this point. The collector came when he could and was not allowed to stay overnight. Missionaries and parish priests were Spain’s culture bearers.

No indios wrote recipes, cookbooks, menu cards, market receipts, food business or restaurant biographies during the first two centuries of the colonial era. The historical food narrative has to be pieced together using official documents and writings by government officials, missionaries, travellers and, as in this new series, even a pirate. Charles Swan was given command of the sailing ship Cygnet to trade British goods in the New World. Instead he joined up with a pirate and raided ships along the American coastline. While likely in the waters of Jalisco, he desired to head into Asia. But the Pacific crossing was notorious. The crew knew the extreme hunger and death from scurvy that Magellan and his men experienced in 1521. The Cygnet’s provisions would not last 60 days even with rations cut to half a pint of maiz daily. Salted jewfish (Atlantic goliath grouper) was the only other food on board. The big-bodied fish had sweet meat and fat. Jews in Jamaica ate them freely because the fish has scales and fins required by Levitical Law. Of all Swan’s arguments that which convinced the crew was his promise to cruise off Manila. The city’s wealth had become mythic. Ships with pieces of eight and silks could be captured. On March 31, 1686 Cygnet raised anchor. Swan increased the food ration from 8 spoonfuls of boiled maiz daily to 10 per man as they sailed with the trade winds.

It was a forlorn post to where exiles and prisoners were sent. An official could threaten anyone making passes at his wife with a sentence to the Marianas. Eventually Chamorros, the resident islanders, had to work two times weekly on government projects that included salt making by women and hunting wild boar by men. Other labors were onerous. Socorro (meaning “relief”) was the annual assistance of goods like food, coin, men to aid the community of Hagatma at the middle of Guam Island, on its west coast. A mile from that settlement is where Swan’s two boats anchored on May 21, 1696 at 11 pm posing as Spaniards.

The Governor replied in a letter later that morning that he appreciated the gifts and would send what provisions “he could possibly spare”. As a token of gratitude he sent 6 hogs, 12 musk melons, many watermelons, and ordered natives at a village near where Swan was anchored to “bake every day as much of the breadfruit as [Swan desired],” and help the visitors get coconuts.

Coconut wine is a product shared by the coconut growing areas of Asia. Dampier described the use of coconut to make wine, just as did Antonio Pigafetta of the circumnavigation crew in 1521. Dampier’s “toddy” looked like “whey”. He wrote: It is sweet and pleasant, but is to be drunk within 24 hours after it is drawn, for afterwards it grows sour. Of all the East Indies native wines much esteemed for making Punch, toddy using sap from the coconut tree made the most delicate.
He recommended adding a dash of brandy because toddy (known as arack; also according to Pigafetta, uraca and tuba) alone did not make good Punch. The duet was chiefly used in Goa and was called Goa Arack. Instead of hanging a bamboo pitcher as Filipinos do, Goans used a “Callabash” with a hole hung on the coconut tree. Coconut cooking and wine-making link the Philippines to its neighbouring nations. An Asian coconut cooking book that includes antique and contemporary uses of tuba should be interesting for world foodies. Arack and alak trace to the Arabic arrack (distillation) and one hopes to learn how the term became so well established in Filipinas. ","William Dampier;

Island native ingredients however were still popular. (Refer to #100philippinefood @felicepstamaria.) When Dampier had abandoned his pirate life and wrote his travel book he described different ways coconut milk was used in Asia. He recorded boiling fowl or any other sort of flesh in coconut milk to make a savoury broth. English seamen had learned from islanders to boil rice with coconut milk and therefore carried coconuts during voyages. By his era the greatest use of coconut was to make “Oyl both for illumination and for frying. The way to make the Oyl is to rasp the kernel, and steep it in fresh water; then boil it, and scum off the Oyl at the top as it rises: But the Nuts that make the Oyl ought to be a long time gathered, so as that the kernel may be turning soft and oily.”
When potable water is unavailable, scarce, or being rationed the coconut has provided liquid for quenching thirst and cooking. Currently a new generation of coconut seedlings need to be planted to aid food security. While Pigafetta in 1521 during the first circumnavigation wrote about coconut water and coconut trees that live to be 100 years old, it seems a tree is most productive for only 30 years. Mama Sita Foundation president Clara Lapus drives home the point, “Many of our trees are now in menopause”.

Among the first food sent to Captain Swan were small hogs that had excellent meat. They were fed coconuts and their flesh was the sturdy texture of beef brisket. A polite and courteous exchange of letters began. The Governor sent two hogs and fruit daily for which he asked in exchange powder shot and arms. He also asked for a large English dog that was like a pet for Swan’s crew. The Spanish official received everything he asked for. On May 30, though, the Governor sent his last gift: several hogs, a jar of pickled mangoes [likely the small, wild growing Philippine “paho” used as the local substitute for olive], a jar of excellent pickled fish, a jar of bread made from fine wheat flour but that was not baked hard like sea biscuit. He also sent 6 to 7 packs of rice. His letter asked that he be “excused from sending any more provision ... [as] he had no more on the Island that he could spare”. He also sent word that the West Monsoon was at hand, that therefore according to Dampier, “it behooved us to be jogging from hence, unless we were resolved to return back to America again”. Swan said his thanks and sent the friar (hostaged since May 21) ashore with gifts for him: a large brass clock, an astrolabe, and a large telescope. The priest gave the pirates 6 hogs, a roasting pig, 3 or 4 bushels of potatoes, and 50 pounds of Manila tobacco. The pirates had also secured as many coconuts as they could stow, a good stock of rice, and 50 hogs preserved in salt. The Magellan-Elcano stay in the Visayas and Mindanao during 1521 had come to value coconuts as tropical provisions. The pirates set their course for Mindanao.

The latter wrote that Libby Trees for sago grew wild in great groves of 5-6 miles long beside rivers. [Nipa palms likely.] Sago was a native staple food for 3-4 months. The tree’s pith is beaten lustily with a wooden pestle in a great mortar or trough after which it is collected in a cloth and held over the trough. Water is poured and the muddy substance collected below is made into cakes serving as bread. Sago was eaten similarly at all the Spice Islands. It was also dried into small pieces resembling seeds that were commonly eaten with almond milk (there is a Javanese almond) to cure those stricken by flux (discharge like diarrhea or even blood). Dampier did not realise yet that sago flour is made from several types of palms including buri. It figures in the Austronesian migration period of the Philippines particularly from the late third and second millennium BC. The SAGHU noted by Pigafetta in Tidore of 1521 may have been from black-thorned “Cycas revolta”. At that time Borneo traded sago as solid loaves. Precolonial sago would have figured in food preparations like BENIGNITY, SALAB, TAMPING, and PALAGSING. There are multiple industrial and commercial uses for sago that go beyond “sago at gulaman,” a Filipino comfort drink.","William Dampier;

Dampier described Mindanao as growing a tree as large as an apple tree with fruit growing directly on the boughs like cacao fruit. He meant the durian that always made for a good story. The fruit “is about the bigness of a large pumpkin and covered with a thick green rough rind.” One wonders why he did not mention that the fruit is surrounded by sharp spikes. “When it is ripe,” he explains, “the rind begins to turn yellow, but it is not fit to eat till it opens at the top.” The ripe fruit inside sends forth an “excellent scent”. Once the rind opens, the durian fruit is quartered. Each quarter has several small cells, the largest as big as a pullet’s egg. “It is as white as milk and as soft as cream, and the taste very delicious to those who are accustomed to them; but those who have not been used to eat them, will dislike them at first because they smell like roasted onions.” Durian can only be eaten at its prime. Over a day or two the fruit blackens and spoils. Its seeds are roasted, peeled and eaten like chestnut, wrote the pirate. A durian paste is still used to make sweets documented during the Spanish colonial era.",Durian;,A durian variety called “Durio zibethinus” possibly after the civet ( Viverra zibetha) known to enjoy eating the fruit.

That was Captain Charles Swan whose expedition sheds insight into food at the start of the second Philippine colonial century. His arrival in Mindanao of 1686 coincided with the westerlies that bring rain and typhoons. The winds so rage that the biggest trees are torn up and are carried into the sea by rivers that overflow their banks. At the southeast end of Mindanao they took shelter in a deep bay on July 4. Again in need of food, the pirates were lucky. The adjacent savannah “abounds with long grass, and it is plentifully stock’d with deer,” wrote Dampier. “The deer live here pretty peacefully and unmolested, for there are no inhabitants on that side of the bay. We visited this Savannah every morning, and killed as many deer as we pleased, sometimes 16 or 18 in a day; and we did eat nothing but venison all the time we stayed.” They were anchored there for 12 days. Archaeological research suggests that deer was part of the prehistoric Philippine diet. Deer was suited to life in flat lands. Wild boar thrived in thick forests. Usa, deer in Tagalog, is now a rare local food.","Charles Swan;

Villagers pointed to “Mindanao City” situated at a river of the same name. Once there they anchored and fired 7 or 9 guns and were answered by 3 guns fired from shore. Swan fired once and a canoa with 10 rowers approached. In it was Rajah Laut (the Maguindanao Sultan’s brother) who demanded in Spanish who they were. “English,” replied Mr. Smith, a prisoner that had taken at Leon, Mexico. The Rajah brothers wanted English to settle in their realm and bring in trade profits. No longer were the Portuguese their enemy but the Spanish and the Dutch. Swan was granted hospitality that extended for the entire season of westerly tempests. Ramadan month began on July 21 in 1686, so Rajah Laut explained he would not entertain Swan with dances and the usual pastimes as it was a solemn time. The “city” was about a mile long and narrow. It followed the winding river bank which when swollen from tempests required movement by canoes. The English ate boiled rice, scraps of fowl or bits of buffalo from the Rajah.

In November Captain Swan had his pirate ship’s bottom changed because it had become worm infested. They celebrated Christmas on board with a lunch of buffalo. His men went hunting having been promised there would be herds of cattle they could use as provisions. The natives had no hunting dogs and it seemed the story of abundant beef nearby was a ruse just to keep the crew around. A third had been living with the natives and lavishing payment (using even gold) for food, company, servants, and rent. As it became obvious that the foreigners were restless, the rajah shocked Swan by demanding payment for all the meals he had consumed since July. The easterlies had settled in and it was the only wind that could carry the ship to the Spiceries. Swan seemed indifferent to his men who wanted action. They were bored. His personal journal that insulted some of his men was found and his men gave him an ultimatum. Instead of addressing the issue with dominance and firmness, he let the situation fester. On January 14, Swan with around 36 of his men who had merchant inclinations were left ashore. The rest of the crew set sail to plunder in Manila! When they got to Zamboanga there were great tracts of hogs and cattle. The sailors had eaten the sweet flesh of green turtle. They saw huge bats, manatees but no fish near Guimaras. At Mindoro by February 18 they found again great herds of hogs and beef. The latter seemed to be a mix of Asian and American breeds. Within the first 40 years of Manila as a Spanish citadel, European cattle from Mexico had been introduced along with ranching. Clearly in 1686 the efforts were paying off. The pirates, now under the command of Captain Read, did not go hungry. (To be continued)","Charles Swan;

It was laden with rice to feed sailors from Mexico during their layover in Cavite. It also carried cotton cloth to make sails. The pirates saw Luzon’s savannahs well stocked with cattle, especially buffalo. The natives lived in towns. Manila Bay was large enough to take hundreds of ships. Usually there were 20 to 40 Chinese “jonks”. The season for successful operations near Manila had however passed, so the mutineers went away to wait for May when an Acapulco galleon would be around for their taking. They anchored at Pulo Condore near Cambodia with a Chinese vessel carrying pepper from Sumatra. 2 pirates died from [food or wine] poisoning in Mindanao.

Only salt was added. As it boiled, it released a strong, fermented odor. The stew was eaten mixed with the raw flesh of 2 or 3 small fish, bones removed and minced very fine. The “dung in the maw” looked like boiled herbs chopped very small. Islanders were not interested in pork paunches.

Their bodies being full, [they] would [be] very moist, their heads would crackle in one’s teeth.” Preparing to sail off in October they salted 70-80 good fat hogs, noted to have naturally sweet flesh, and bought yams and potatoes that made good store to eat at sea.

Growing were banana, durian, guava, jackfruit, lime, musk melon, orange, pineapple, potato, sugarcane, watermelon, yam. Palm flour was made into a native bread. Rice boiled in water or sago and a small fish or two made up the common food in Mindanao (Maguindanao). Meat was for the better-off. Spoons were not used. One takes a handful of rice from a communal platter. By wetting the hand in water so the rice won’t stick to the hand, one takes rice, squeezes it as hard as possible into a lump that is placed in the mouth. Scraps of fowl or buffalo were mixed into boiled rice. Coconut meat was rasped and made into milk for cooking rice or fowl. There were tame duck and hen as well as wild bat, boar, buffalo, cow, deer, varieties of fish, locust, manatee, pidgeon, sea turtle. There was also goat and swine. Wine was made from coconut or sugarcane. Water was the beverage at meals in Mindanao. Locust was toasted in a pan and grass from goat innards boiled at Batanes. Raw fish was eaten there, too. Spanish made pickled fish and pickled mango (the small paho kind resembling an olive). They baked bread using wheat flour. There were flora, fauna, cooked foods and processed wines that differed from one part of the archipelago from another. Western sailors salted pork for voyages, and learned from islanders to bring coconuts as survival food.","Cooking--Philippines;

He is commended as one of the most important British explorers and navigators of his era. He cited many foods and food plants in his book and is the first European to describe the making of guacamole. He possibly gave breadfruit its English name. From 1703-1707 he completed a second circumnavigation. The pirate in him never went away.

Unripe its fruit was “used in marinating other dishes.” Its taste was like that of a “good peach but with greater fragrance.” The tree was “brought in from abroad, but here it grows so well that it seems to be in its own native environment.” The pajo looked “very much like the manga, except that it is small.” It was “only served steeped in brine, forming a substitute for olive.” Such was noted quite early in the first century of colonisation. The friar continues: “It is tasty and is a good appetite. It is given to the sick to increase their appetite and the indios like it very much.” It was paho brined rather than pickled perhaps that the pirates traveling with Swan and Dampier were given in Guam prior to their Mindanao visit.

The wine “most commonly used by the indios, which is most healthful for the Spaniards, is that made from a palm called nipa by the Visayas and sasa by the Tagalogs.” It thrived in brackish water along riverbanks. Sap was gathered from the inflorescence and distilled using fire. The result was spirits milder than that of European wines but good for the health if used moderately. Tuba from coconut he considered “stronger and better” than nipa wine. Even “more refreshing.” San Antonio added that “There is no lack of European wine”. There was a Mexican wine made from herbs brought in, but it gave Spaniards “verven” (like dropsy) that killed them. Water not wine was had with meals. Wine was for toasting for a special event or feast. He added that native wines complemented the imported Spanish ones, “specially if blended with them or other healthy and tasty spices.” One senses Spanish cuisine developing colonial changes. Both colonisers and colonized affected each other’s cuisines.","Fr. Juan Francisco de San Antonio;

San Antonio described “balimbin” as like a large “friar plum” that was oblong rather than globular in shape. The tropical Southeast Asian botanical along with other cultigens for coconut, lanzones and santol is now said to have been introduced by ancient Austronesians. Balimbin fruited all year round. “Its preserve, whether dried or in syrup, is in great demand here [Filipinas] and in New Spain.” One wonders if culinary interest in them can be resurrected? While still unripe, balimbin was sour and used as a condiment. A variety imported for planting from Terrenate [Indonesia] grew large fruit eaten when ripe for their exceptional sweetness. In the colony’s 150th year culinary and medicinal values of native botanicals had become familiar to missionaries. Up to this period only religious were allowed by law to live and mix with the indios. San Antonio could still distinguish what plants came from Spain (grapes from Parras; small lemons from Ceuta) and from the New World (atis, anonas, zapotes, chicozapotes, chirinoyas, papayas).

It was made into preserves, dried in the sun, salted, and stewed. “It is very abundantly and very much in demand by the indio who has a preference for sour fruits,” he added. Camias was also sour. Natives ate them sliced small in their juice; Spaniards ate them preserved like balimbin. The “duhat” resembled an olive and was seasoned or marinated similarly. Pineapple had already adapted to Philippine terroir from its home in the New World. San Antonio explained it is soaked in water and eaten with a little salt to counter colic. [The same habit was reported in the Caribbean. Pineapple may have originated in Brazil.] Salt made in Manila was as “fine, white and safe as that from Spain”; indio-made salt was said to be harmful. Manila salt was made by Chinese in vast amounts. They built ponds for filling with sea water that through the sun-evaporation process left sea salt. The friar was ecstatic about plants and fruit trees the islands were blessed with. Those seldom seen today in markets include mabolo, banquilin, anona.","Salt--Manila (Philippines);

Tattoos were a thing of the past among Bisayans. Chocolate beverage made the Spanish way (not the Aztec style) had become popular and was served in “naturally small size” coconut shell cups. Cups, dishes and glasses of coconut shell were “finely carved”. The coconut shells were shipped to New Spain to be encased in silver where they were in demand. Palo Naga wood was carved into cups. To cure indigestion, one drank water turned blue by the wood. The Spaniards had come to like native “snacks” that would require “a large catalogue,” wrote San Antonio. Yet the common native meal was not Hispanized. Wheat bread never replaced rice served in dishes. Tustus, the layer of burned rice at the bottom of a cooking pot was placed atop rice being cooked.

Being plentiful, islanders got what river or ocean protein was needed with a “minimum of cost and work”. Rice was flavoured with salt or sawsauan (used by some Spanish as the equivalent of “salsa,” sauce). “With this scanty diet (which is well liked by them) most of them manage to live and even grow fat.” There were also appetisers soaked in vinegar and salt. Fish and meat were dried in the sun or over a fire to make what they called “tapa”. Being preserved, the protein could be eaten little by little as needed. Natives ate little meat, either “because their stomachs prefer fish or they cannot afford it. However they do eat meat in feasts if it is given to them, or if they find it in the fields.” Deer, carabao and wild pig remained abundant. Wild carabao, being domesticated for agricultural use, was “stronger than a strong bull”. Spanish cow had been introduced from stock bred in Mexico during the late 1500s. Natives had acquired a taste for beef even if it was originally loathsome to them. The Philippine food heritage of rice and seafood traces far into precolonial times.

Overseas Chinese workers and resident Sangley Mestizos did. Fr. San Antonio explains that the latter “did not exist at the time of the discovery”. Usually the offspring was from a Christian Chinese father and a Christian indio mother. They were “very hard working and civilized [and] make it a point to imitate all that is European, but they tend to remain apart. They live in the same towns of the Tagalogs, but they form a distinct group”. Pampanga also had many Sangley Mestizo. It is only in this era close to the 150th colonial year that the Sangley Mestizo became many and enough to warrant a separate tax classification. Indios could gather their food from wild plants still growing in abundance. They did begin cultivating pumpkins, sitao, bulay-patani, mustard greens, ikmo, bonga, and mongo. The latter was recognised as a good food for victims of scurvy; broth from it was used to cure smallpox. [Mongo could be sold to provision the galleon.] Apalea also called amargoso bore fruit to be a “codo” long (from the elbow to the tip of the middle finger) and was eaten as a salad and in stew. A wild tree yet to be identified with surety was called Col de Maluco. Its leaves were used popularly by indios in cooking.

Annual tribute was accepted in currency already, but only half the total. Payment in a rice quota continued so men working for the government could get paid their rice ration. Fr. San Antonio describes 24 fortresses and garrisons from Cagayan to Zamboanga in addition to the more heavily protected ones at Manila and Cavite. Some had only a handful of soldiers. Chaplains and military hospitals were also allocated a fixed amount of rice annually. Fr. San Antonio writes that every year over around 9,500 kilos of rice were allocated for soldiers of the Royal Service. Indios and not Spanish were farming. Although there were over 100 parishes (that also had the political status of pueblos), the interior lands of provinces like Pampanga were still wild and uncultivated. They were populated by wild pagans and vagabonds. The latter included men registered as parish residents but who ran away to escape polo — the required 40 days of labor on government projects. The work ranged from church maintenance, felling trees for lumber, and building ships to rowing during war. Those doing polo were supposed to be given a daily rice ration.

In 1701 the superiors of the friar orders and the Jesuits in Filipinas sent a Remonstrance to the Governor-General criticising the abuses of encomenderos. They had been given temporary use of royal lands but were to develop them and help Christianise the indios there. Agriculture floundered, the parish-pueblo was threatened, and population declined. In 1686, as the second colonial century started the estimated population calculated from tributes was “over 600,00”; in 1588 it was 673,600. In 1718 the King promulgated an order that returned encomiendas to his estate. He could develop them according to new strategies. As the 150th colonial year approached the native population recovered as did products from the lands they farmed. But they would be challenged by usury and usurpation of farmlands by friar orders. Only religious were allowed into the grassroots still during San Antonio’s residency.","Philippines--History--1521-1896;

Although indios were not allowed to invest in the galleon trade, the business offered profits from supplying provisions: salt, dried beef and fish, wheat and wheat sea biscuit, coconut shell cups and bowls for the crew, coconut wine, rice, mongo for instance. Only registered Manila residents could participate in the galleon trade. In its heyday an investor could earn 300 percent. The number of galleons allowed per year became limited to only one. The ship’s carrying capacity was measured and divided into shares. Since a limit also was set to the total value of trade goods going to New Spain (P500,000) and back (P1,000,000) each share had a corresponding peso value. Costs had to be shared to outfit the galleon, pay port fees and wages of the crew. City officials had allocations. Poor residents including widows found rich parties as partners. “This forms a kind of general assistance not found in Europe and its dominions,” concluded Fr. San Antonio. The colonials became so dependent on galleon income that if a ship did not return the colony’s economy was jeopardised till another galleon could be constructed, stocked and return home. Fr. San Antonio warned of another change confronting Filipinas during the first half of the second colonial century. Philippine commerce was on the decline and ministers needed to protect and grow the colony’s industrial wealth.  ","Philippines--Commerce--Spain;

The trading company model managed by merchants was already in place among British (starting 1600), Dutch (1602) and French (1664). They were dealing directly with the Chinese. Manila was still exporting pearls and gems from India; rubies and cinnamon from Ceylon; Sumatran and Javanese pepper; clove and nutmeg from Maluco and Banda; Persian rugs from Ormuz; rich bedcovers from Bengal; high quality camphor from Borneo; Lequios musk; and ivory, rhinoceros or unicorn horns from Siam, Cambodia and Cochin China. China still brought to Manila silks, velvets, cotton blankets, porcelain, shawls, and curiosities of great price. Manila was still the transhipment depot that had started in the 16th century. The Chinese who shifted from paper to metal currency had no silver. Spanish pieces of eight paid for goods that were brought to Manila gave China silver. It is said that until 1750 (uncannily around the end of the Conquista in Filipinas) providing China with silver was at the center of the global economy. What San Antonio seems to have been pointing out is that Filipinas had rich natural resources ranging from gold and wax to civet, cacao, sugar and other food products. Yet Filipinas was not growing partly because there was no attention to agriculture. No one was investing in the colony’s production of goods for export.","Commerce--History;

San Antonio summarised the major food crops growing from 1724 till around 1738. Samar: its plains are fertile producing an abundance of rice. Negros: fertile to rice “with which the natives supply Zebu and other islands around it”. In Cebu the “common food because there is very little rice” was a “seed they call borona which looks like millet, with a smaller grain and more straw”; also grown were garlic, onion, and a “lot of cacao, that of this area having the highest quality and being in great demand.” Mindoro was cited for abundant buri and yonote palms for sagu that is made into the “common bread”; it was not rice rich. The Province of Calamianes grew rice, vegetables, fruits; natives bred a “large number of pigs and chickens.” Mindanao produced an “abundance of rice and roots common [with] the Bisayas”. There was wild cinnamon and 25 towns on the coast of Cagayan, Dapitan and Samboangan cultivated the trees. It was mixed with Ceylonese cinnamon to acquire the export grade of “fine”. There were “beautiful and abundant wild vineyards of grapes”. In Jolo planted crops are not identified, only that there were many edible nests of the salangan bird; also perhaps for their eggs, many tabon birds. The Province of Caraga made salt and grew “rice for its own consumption” as well as good cacao, a botanical introduced to the colony only around 50 years earlier. There is not much mention of food crop diversity. Missions still were mostly along island coastlines (trying to be beyond flood lines) or inland along rivers; interior areas were still being Christianised and parishes created. New botanicals from the the Americas, China and other Asian sources would arrive mostly via missionaries who were still the only Spanish allowed to live and work among the folk for the first 150 years of the colonial experience.","Natural resources--Philippines;

San Antonio it is important to glimpse some non-culinary changes he observed. One senses the mingling of Spanish and indio cultures in the early 1700s. Indios of rank had shifted from using the honorifics “Lakan” and “Gat” to the Castilian “Don”. He credited Tagalog for being a most cultured and formal language, citing its use of “po” and “po co”. The former was used by males, the second by females. It was discourteous to leave out either when speaking. There were many other phrases by which manners were still being well expressed. Children were being named after Pope Pio V and King Felipe V. Paternal surnames after the baptismal name, he wrote, “is now being introduced”. But men would forget their official names because once their first child was born, say Rosa, they would be known for the rest of their life as “Ama ni Rosa” (Father of Rosa). The custom was confusing for ascertaining censuses and tributes. These Spanish customs accompanied, as noted in a previous vignette, the start of men and women dressing in the Spanish way. As described in earlier stories about the end of the first colonial century, Spanish musical instruments and harmony were in place. Priests contributed food during fiestas when pig was served. Parishes became Spanish-like as they stabilized.","Spain--Colonies--Asia--Social life and customs;

During days of sorrow such as sipa one ate only vegetables. The pagan custom called “tibao” was still active according to San Antonio. On the third or fourth day at mealtime, “the best place was left vacant for the dead guest” while relatives would “eat and drink in a splendid feast” and recount the good deeds of the deceased in stories and songs. Missionaries were removing the superstitious feature and instead emphasising prayers for the deceased during tibao. Weddings had three days of eating, drinking, dancing and singing. A pagan practice that had been eliminated was for the bride and groom on their bridal bed, to each sit on the laps of old women serving as marriage sponsors. The women would hand feed the couple from the same plate and have them both drink from the same cup. The couple would pledge their love and guests would shout in gaiety, drink, dance, sing. The pagan priestess called a “catalona” would then rise and extend many blessings to the newlyweds. Customs were not uniform throughout the archipelago although there were similarities. The Catholic priest had to assert new church customs. By linking them to existing practices, the new rituals could slip into indio lifestyle. As other records note, the inclusion of pork, sweets and alcoholic beverage during fiestas aided mission work. Food was a tool of religious conversion.","Fasts and feasts--Catholic Church;

Juan San Antonio whose chronicle we have been featuring could indeed take pride in seeing the results of their cumulative efforts since 1565. Not only were the numbers of indio and Sangley converts rising. Parishes were being settled, with a church, a government headquarters, houses along streets (still unpaved) laid out like a grid iron and each with a garden of edibles, plus chickens and pigs, even goats. Priests were proud to point out how well they knew their assigned venues including native plants that substituted for unavailable European ingredients. In early years, some priests worked in the fields side by side with the folk. They were “fathers” linked to their “children” and the farms, infrastructure, and successful growth of imported flora and fauna they worked hard to plant. San Antonio notes “pile”. Its seed looks like pine nut seed and substitutes for almond. “When green it can be eaten with its skin, like young almonds. It should be scalded with boiling water like raisins. If kept too long in water, it becomes hard and cannot be eaten.” A century in the future, pili would be made into Spanish turron and given as gifts with pride. Missionaries of the 1500s through early 1700s still were inspired passionately by the Counter-Reformation. Later friars seemed to have lost their desire for grassroots work as our stories will tell. But during San Antonio’s era, many missionaries devoted their entire adult lives to conversion and parish development. From 1598 to 1737 there had been only 13 Archbishops of Manila. Staying in position for around 10 to 20 years was common. The tenure of Governor-Generals was only around 3 to 4 years and did not build a lasting affection for Filipinas and its colonised.

Father San Antonio explains that the natives were ready believers of the new religion. “They are the most inclined to the Church and its feasts and ceremonies, but it is necessary to use the force of the whip to get them to hear mass on holidays of obligation and to confess and receive communion... They are very reverent to the Father Ministers because of the superiority they recognise in them, but at the same time make fun of them,” he writes. The indios were capable in any trade which they work at, he observed and “would be even more capable if they were less lazy or if their greed for temporal goods were greater. Because of this, they have always been, are, and will be poor, not caring to have more than is necessary to eat today”. Food accounts are interspersed among observations praising what the environs and era offer as well as perplexing evaluations that are patronising and condescending. It is within such a conflicting background that culinary changes occurred. Food studies cannot be separated from their social milieu.","Spain--Colonies--Asia--Religious life and customs;

The government rigorously established its measures. The CABAN, meaning storage chest in Tagalog, was an ancient measure that equalled 24 GANTAS. They were re-standardised according to the FANEGA, a Spanish measure of volume. In the colony, 1 caban equaled 1 fanega. But when polished rice, called bigas, was measured as the King’s regular subsidy for the Church and its missions, 1 fanega was defined as 48 gantas of palay that made 20 gantas of polished rice. “The King, in his charity, so as to give us the rice for our maintenance without waste [the husk], established the measure of [bigas] arbitrarily, such that it comes out double,” Fr. Juan de San Antonio, OFM explained. The old Tagalog GATANG or GABINAN was the amount of bigas for a “man’s single meal”. To measure a gatang was called TACAL. The gatang equalled one CHUPA. There were 16 chupas in 1 almud and 4 almuds in a fanega. So there were 64 chupas or gatang or individual rice servings in every fanega. One wonders if 20 gantas of bigas fed 64 servings. The 1 ganta measure of volume has been calculated today as roughly 2.5 kilos in weight of rice. 1 kilo can feed 12 persons. So 1 ganta can feed 30 persons. 20 gantas would have fed approximately 600 persons. While there was dependency on the Crown’s rice contribution, missionaries sought to maximise harvests of rice fields in their parishes sure that food shortages were annual.","Filipinos--Taxation;

Fr. San Antonio said indios had a strong preference for fish or meat that was “somewhat smelly, which to [us] is a strange taste”. Iguana made a tasty dish. Frogs were “in demand by the Indian as food”. Laguna de Bai had plenty of swordfish. Large whales were found in seas of Jolo and Mindanao Island. Butuanons of northern Mindanao were “worthy of eternal memories and gratitude having been the first who gave shelter to the Catholic men-at-arms ... the first land where the celebrated Magellan planted the domain of Jesus Christ and that of our Catholic King.” San Antonio wrote: “The island of Zebu or Sogbu (which is its proper name) was the first one favored by God with the first planting of the Holy Tree of the Cross and the establishment of Christianity”. Mactan island was “where Magellan was unfortunately killed”. Other sites visited by the first circumnavigation armada were not identified by him. In the 171st year of the colony, the total indio Christian population had reached around 837,182; the number of churches totalled 700. There were no figures for the “fluid” Spanish population he said. Indios were acquiring Hispanic influences even if Spanish lay were not yet allowed to live amongst them. One may presume they were due to the priests who had become well entrenched. That civil officials knelt to kiss the hand of a priest seemed a sign that religion was more powerful than the state according to other authors.","Rice;
